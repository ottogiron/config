# myvimrc

My custom vimrc. This Setup is still working but I'm migrating to neovim with nvim.lazy.

Requires https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.

## Instructions for  vim-plug 

1. Copy it to ~/.vimrc
2. open vim  running `vim`
3. Inside vim run `:PlugInstall`

## Instructions for neovim

1. Copy it to ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
